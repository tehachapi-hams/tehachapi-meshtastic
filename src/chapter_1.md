# Configuration

This booklet assumes that you are familiar with the basics of Meshtastic... And that's not a great assumption, because not many folks are.

- **It is recommended, that you read through the [Meshtastic Documentation first](https://meshtastic.org/docs/introduction/)**, and testing with your own local radio, before joining the local network.

- This booklet is mostly just reference material for configuration.
