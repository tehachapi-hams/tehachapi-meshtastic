# Hardware

I am honestly not super up to date with the hardware that Meshtastic supports
now, but you can [browse devices here](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/).

As we learn more, we can document more, or point you to local people who can
help with specific hardware.

You can get started with radios that cost less than $20:

- I have had good luck with the
[2019 LILYGO T-Beam T22 v1.1](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/tbeam/?t-beam=1.1),
but it's a 5 year old device. Newer devices are just as cheap and likely "better."

- Various users (and myself), use the [Heltec V3.1](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/heltec/), which is available from Heltec for as low as $17-19 + shipping.

- I have started long term testing of the [Rak kits](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/rak/)
for solar nodes, and while a bit more expensive, open up some convenient routes to the Solar Power
enclosures from Rak.
