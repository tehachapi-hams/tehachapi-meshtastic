# Hardware

I am honestly not super up to date with the hardware that Meshtastic supports
now, but you can [browse devices here](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/).

As we learn more, we can document more, or point you to local people who can
help with specific hardware.

You can get started with radios that cost less than $30.

I have had good luck with the
[2019 LILYGO T-Beam T22 v1.1](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/tbeam/?t-beam=1.1),
but it's a 5 year old device. Newer devices are just as cheap and likely "better."
