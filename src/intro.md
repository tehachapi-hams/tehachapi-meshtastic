# Introduction

Various folks through the years have expressed interest in
[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) in the Tehachapi area. I have been running
nodes up here since ~2020, just not very well.

As of April 2024, I decided to upgrade the gear with new batteries and fresh
firmware, and am publicly announcing shared configuration settings, so others
can experiment with other deployed nodes.

LoRa can operate in completely unlicensed low power mode, and Amateur Radio
Licensees can operate at higher power.

Coordination is done via the [tehachapi-hams](https://groups.io/g/tehachapi-hams)
mailing list.

Some of these instructions may be just plain wrong for running a Meshtastic
network, but we only learn by doing. Please feel free to contribute to the
GitHub repository for this book: [https://github.com/tehachapi-hams/tehachapi-meshtastic](https://github.com/tehachapi-hams/tehachapi-meshtastic),
or submit corrections via the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tehachapi-hams/tehachapi-meshtastic/issues)
for this project.

Alternative to [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org), is 
[MeshCom](https://icssw.org/en/meshcom/), but I think it's "too hammy" for
folks seeking to operate with the more conservative regulation in an
unlicensed mode. I'm not opposed to using something like MeshCom for a
backbone to neighboring communities.

## Various Legal Incantations

event this repository does, please just let me know and I can change it.
