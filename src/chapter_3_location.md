# Location

## Choosing a location

LoRa works well with Line of Sight, and Tehachapi is small enough, that with perfect
clearance, a node on one side of the valley could hit a node on the other
side (both north to south and east to west).

Tehachapi has many many foothills and ridgelines, that impede this level of
direct connectivity. While high points would be welcome additions,
accessability is limited in the winter. I personally have been aiming for
"many cheap nodes" that can be deployed at peoples homes or offices. It's
more stuff to break, but less stuff to break all at once.
