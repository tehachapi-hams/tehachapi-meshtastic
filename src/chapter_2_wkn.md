# Well Known Nodes

## Downtown Tehachapi

### `dt01` / `downtown-01`

KN6QOQ operates a single node from downtown, that's generally stable and backed
by a UPS unit. The antenna placement is sub-optimal, but seems to generally get
about a mile of coverage.

## Alpine Forest

### `av01` / `alpine-village-01`

KN6QOQ operates a single node from the South East side of Alpine Forest
(sometimes called Alpine Village), near Indian Hills Campground, that's
generally stable and backed by a UPS unit. The antenna placement is
sub-optimal. This is in a small valley, so coverage is limited.
